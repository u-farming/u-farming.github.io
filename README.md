# u-farming.org - Home of the open urban farming community

This open source project aims at collaboratively cultivating software, hardware, know-how
and best-practices on the urban farming topic. Planting your own grocery, fruit or mushrooms
locally is more than fun, especially for kids!

Feel invited to experimentally find ways on how to e.g. increase yield or reduce energy
requirements. Build your own home fridge sized farming "enclosure". Or think big and refactor
a shipping container and start growing salad for your neighbourhood. Just ensure to share your
ideas and experiences -- with this friendly, growing community :)

This project is not seeking a silver bullet solution. Like we configure software programs
at runtime nowadays, u-farming.org's goal is to collect modular solutions, which can be
mix-matched as needed by urban farming container builders around the world.

## urban farming links

To get started, we're building [a curated list of websites related to urban farming](/awesome-farming/)!

Please help improve it by filing Pull Requests. Thank you ... and github, for making websites like this one possible - for free.
